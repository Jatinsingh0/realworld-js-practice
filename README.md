# 🔍 Real-Life JavaScript Problem Solving

Hi there! 👋 I'm currently working on a self-initiated challenge where I solve **real-life JavaScript problems** inspired by practical web development scenarios.

These problems are not textbook exercises — they are situations developers face regularly while building real-world applications. This includes tasks like:

- Form handling and validation
- Debounced search (e.g., e-commerce search bars)
- API error handling
- Authentication flows
- Dynamic UI updates
- Responsive design logic
- Performance optimizations using techniques like memoization, throttling, etc.
- Many more...

## 🚀 Goals

- Sharpen JavaScript and React fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving for real frontend situations
- Document multiple approaches to solving the same problem
- Build a robust GitHub repository that shows practical coding skills

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React.js
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js & Express (for backend cases)
- MongoDB (for basic data scenarios)
